@article{Nayak2008,
abstract = {Topological quantum computation has recently emerged as one of the most exciting approaches to constructing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The proposal relies on the existence of topological states of matter whose quasiparticle excitations are neither bosons nor fermions, but are particles known as \{$\backslash$it Non-Abelian anyons\}, meaning that they obey \{$\backslash$it non-Abelian braiding statistics\}. Quantum information is stored in states with multiple quasiparticles, which have a topological degeneracy. The unitary gate operations which are necessary for quantum computation are carried out by braiding quasiparticles, and then measuring the multi-quasiparticle states. The fault-tolerance of a topological quantum computer arises from the non-local encoding of the states of the quasiparticles, which makes them immune to errors caused by local perturbations. To date, the only such topological states thought to have been found in nature are fractional quantum Hall states, most prominently the $\backslash$nu=5/2 state, although several other prospective candidates have been proposed in systems as disparate as ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices and thin film superconductors. In this review article, we describe current research in this field, focusing on the general theoretical concepts of non-Abelian statistics as it relates to topological quantum computation, on understanding non-Abelian quantum Hall states, on proposed experiments to detect non-Abelian anyons, and on proposed architectures for a topological quantum computer. We address both the mathematical underpinnings of topological quantum computation and the physics of the subject using the $\backslash$nu=5/2 fractional quantum Hall state as the archetype of a non-Abelian topological state enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

It comes natural to ask one-self whether this choice has to be considered as compulsory, or attempts can be made in order to characterize the configurations in an alternative way. We focus our attention to two suggested characterization of configurations, either by points on a sphere (Majorana), or by the knowledge of the mean values of a suitable chosen set of observables (Fano). As a physical system, we consider here the "observative characterization" in interferometry, with particular attention to the case in which the apparatus detects two photons.},

@article{DeBoer1996,
abstract = {We construct the path integral for one-dimensional non-linear sigma models, starting from a given Hamiltonian operator and states in a Hilbert space. By explicit evaluation of the discretized propagators and vertices we find the correct Feynman rules which differ from those often assumed. These rules, which we previously derived in bosonic systems, are now extended to fermionic systems. We then generalize the work of Alvarez-Gaum\'{e} and Witten by developing a framework to compute anomalies of an n-dimensional quantum field theory by evaluating perturbatively a corresponding quantum mechanical path integral. Finally, we apply this formalism to various chiral and trace anomalies, and solve a series of technical problems: (i) the correct treatment of Majorana fermions in path integrals with coherent states (the methods of fermion doubling and fermion halving yield equivalent results when used in applications to anomalies), (ii) a complete path integral treatment of the ghost sector of chiral Yang-Mills anomalies, (iii) a complete path integral treatment of trace anomalies, (iv) the supersymmetric extension of the Van Vleck determinant, and (v) a derivation of the spin-3/2 Jacobian of Alvarez-Gaum\'{e} and Witten for Lorentz anomalies.},

@article{Balian1963,
abstract = {In previous treatments of superconducting systems with attractive interactions acting in odd-angular-momentum partial waves, the correlated electron pairs were formed in only two components of a spin triplet. This oversight is corrected here by a more general variational treatment, allowing all three components. In the case of a p-wave interaction, the present state is proved to give the absolute minimum of the free energy. Its rotational degeneracy is discussed. The energy spectrum is found to be isotropic (provided the normal phase is also) with the usual gap, and so to be completely equivalent thermodynamically to the BCS state. The charge-density autocorrelation is also isotropic, and the charge-current correlation vanishes. The state exhibits the conventional Meissner effect, and cannot be experimentally distinguished from the BCS state by means of electromagnetic or tunneling measurements, acoustic attenuation, or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation times. The paramagnetic spin susceptibility decreases with temperature from its value in the normal phase to a limiting ratio of 2/3, in good agreement with results deduced from Knight shift measurements on mercury and tin, and in contrast to the BCS prediction. However, the addition of impurities is found to reduce the critical temperature sharply (again in contrast to the BCS case). Thus, the experimental observation of the p-wave pair state is expected to be difficult, and the agreement with Knight shift data is probably fortuitous. Finally, it is suggested that a similar effect in He3 might explain why the predicted superfluid phase has not been observed.},

abstract = {We discuss a notion of quantum critical exponents in open quantum many-body systems driven by quantum noise. We show that in translationally invariant quantum lattice models undergoing quasi-local Markovian dissipative processes, mixed states emerge as stationary points that show scaling laws for the divergence of correlation lengths giving rise to well-defined critical exponents. The main new technical tool developed here is a complete description of steady states of free bosonic or fermionic translationally invariant systems driven by quantum noise: This approach allows to express all correlation properties in terms of a symbol, paralleling the Fisher-Hartwig theory used for ground state properties of free models. We discuss critical exponents arising in bosonic and fermionic models. Finally, we relate the findings to recent work on dissipative preparation of pure dark and matrix product states by Markovian noisy processes and sketch further perspectives.},

abstract = {Topological states of fermionic matter can be induced by means of a suitably engineered dissipative dynamics. Dissipation then does not occur as a perturbation, but rather as the main resource for many-body dynamics, providing a targeted cooling into topological phases starting from arbitrary initial states. We explore the concept of topological order in this setting, developing and applying a general theoretical framework based on the system density matrix that replaces the wave function appropriate for the discussion of Hamiltonian ground-state physics. We identify key analogies and differences to the more conventional Hamiltonian scenario. Differences essentially arise from the fact that the properties of the spectrum and of the state of the system are not as tightly related as in the Hamiltonian context. We provide a symmetry-based topological classification of bulk steady states and identify the classes that are achievable by means of quasi-local dissipative processes driving into superfluid paired states. We also explore the fate of the bulk-edge correspondence in the dissipative setting and demonstrate the emergence of Majorana edge modes. We illustrate our findings in one- and two-dimensional models that are experimentally realistic in the context of cold atoms.},

abstract = {The 1937 theoretical discovery of Majorana fermions-whose defining property is that they are their own anti-particles-has since impacted diverse problems ranging from neutrino physics and dark matter searches to the fractional quantum Hall effect and superconductivity. Despite this long history the unambiguous observation of Majorana fermions nevertheless remains an outstanding goal. This review paper highlights recent advances in the condensed matter search for Majorana that have led many in the field to believe that this quest may soon bear fruit. We begin by introducing in some detail exotic 'topological' one- and two-dimensional superconductors that support Majorana fermions at their boundaries and at vortices. We then turn to one of the key insights that arose during the past few years; namely, that it is possible to 'engineer' such exotic superconductors in the laboratory by forming appropriate heterostructures with ordinary s-wave superconductors. Numerous proposals of this type are discussed, based on diverse materials such as topological insulators, conventional semiconductors, ferromagnetic metals and many others. The all-important question of how one experimentally detects Majorana fermions in these setups is then addressed. We focus on three classes of measurements that provide smoking-gun Majorana signatures: tunneling, Josephson effects and interferometry. Finally, we discuss the most remarkable properties of condensed matter Majorana fermions-the non-Abelian exchange statistics that they generate and their associated potential for quantum computation.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive analysis of critical behavior in the driven-dissipative Bose condensation transition in three spatial dimensions. Starting point is a microscopic description of the system in terms of a many-body quantum master equation, where coherent and driven-dissipative dynamics occur on an equal footing. An equivalent Keldysh real time functional integral reformulation opens up the problem to a practical evaluation using the tools of quantum field theory. In particular, we develop a functional renormalization group approach to quantitatively explore the universality class of this stationary non-equilibrium system. Key results comprise the emergence of an asymptotic thermalization of the distribution function, while manifest non-equilibrium properties are witnessed in the response properties in terms of a new, independent critical exponent. Thus the driven-dissipative microscopic nature is seen to bear observable consequences on the largest length scales. The absence of two symmetries present in closed equilibrium systems - underlying particle number conservation and detailed balance, respectively - is identified as the root of this new non-equilibrium critical behavior. Our results are relevant for broad ranges of open quantum systems on the interface of quantum optics and many-body physics, from exciton-polariton condensates to cold atomic gases.},
