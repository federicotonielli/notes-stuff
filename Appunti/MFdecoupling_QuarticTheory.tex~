\begin{itemize}
 \item notation used: conjugate of a Grassmann field and of a product of fields, Fourier transform of $a(x)$ and $\obar{a}(x)$
 \item what will precede this chapter: careful study of the time regularization prescription: $t$ and $t+\delta$ as in Appendix A of \cite{Sieberer2014} + 1st order perturbation theory, normal ordering as in the Hamiltonian case, argument for the equivalence of the two approaches
 \item analysis of the MF decoupling performed at the level of the QME in Appendix A of  % \cite{Bardyn2013}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item  \textcolor{blue}{fate of the U(1) gauge symmetry (phase of the order parameter completely arbitrary)}
  \item \textcolor{blue}{fate of the $\mathbb{R}^*$ gauge symmetry (modulus of the order parameter determined by fixing the density)}
  \item \textcolor{blue}{what is the simplest basis for the decoupling and what is the most suitable way to collect the fermionic fields into spinors}
  \item \textcolor{blue}{how many and which are potential Hubbard-Stratonovich fields: $aa$ and $a^+a^+$ terms can be decoupled via a single complex field in the usual Cooper pair channel, $a^+a$ and $aa^+$ apparently not (the final combination replaced by a Hub-Strat field will in fact be a \textit{symmetrized sum of them}).}
 \end{itemize} 
 \item field theory of the quartic QME in terms of the $\Psi$ spinors in the $\pm$ basis
 \item field theory of the MF quadratic QME as above; matrix form for it and identification of the coefficients with averages of operators
 \item decoupling ansatz based on the discussion above and the explicit breaking of the $\mathbb{R}^*$ gauge invariance, with real/complex diagonal $\alpha$ and complex off-diagonal $\beta$ fields
 \item while $\beta$ produces, after integration, a term of the form $-L^+L$, $\alpha$ produces instead $+L^+L$: we need to tune the relative coefficients in their quadratic action to produce the correct coefficient of $L^+L$ (either $+1$ or $-\frac{1}{2}$)
 \item a real $\alpha$ produces two additional terms which are identically 0: normal ordering doesn't change the result because it can be taken into account with the time regularization prescription, regardless of which these terms still vanish
 \item possible decoupled actions: values of the relative coefficients of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in all the possible cases ($\alpha$ real/complex,$+1 / -\frac{1}{2}$)
 \item is there a simple matrix form for the decoupled action? the quadratic part of the Hub-Strat fields is $Tr[M^+M]$ for $++$ and $--$, but it's not so simple in the $-+$ sector; the interaction vertex is something like $Tr[(\obar{\Psi}\Psi)^+ M ]+Tr[M^+(\obar{\Psi}\Psi)]$
 \item observations:
  \begin{itemize} 
  \item these new fields correspond to the right combination of the old ones!
  \item as already said, the $\mathbb{R}^*$ gauge symmetry is broken; it is meaningful: this symmetry changes the relative weight between pumps and losses in the quadratic theory; we switch from a description where the number of particles is conserved (exact match between pumps and losses) to one where only the density is fixed; since fixing the density is equivalent to fixing the ratio between pumps and losses, the symmetry which changes it must be broken
  \item the U(1)xU(1) gauge symmetry can be fully restored (U(1) gauge symmetry transformations of all the fields); the price we have to pay is to use a complex $\alpha$ field in the $\pm$ sector
  \end{itemize}
  \item final form of the action in a matrix and matrixless fashion 
\end{itemize}
